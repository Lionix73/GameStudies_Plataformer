# Rescuebot
## Description
Rescuebot is a 2D puzzle platformer set in a post-apocalyptic world consumed by ice and darkness. The player controls Eclipse, an automated robot, tasked with finding a solution to save humanity from its grim fate. Eclipse must traverse desolate, dangerous environments while managing limited resources and solving puzzles to progress through a ruined industrial landscape.

## Main Mechanics:
- **Puzzle-solving and platforming** in a world where everything is abandoned, forcing the player to creatively find resources.
- **Resource management with a risk/reward focus.** The harsh environment limits the player’s time, testing quick thinking and decision-making.
- **Survival-based gameplay**, where the player must gather essential resources to continue.

  *Note: A movement asset has been used in the development of this project. [2D Controller](https://github.com/Matthew-J-Spencer/Ultimate-2D-Controller)*

## Narrative:
As Eclipse ventures deeper into the frozen world, its human operator, Emily, begins to question whether humanity is worth saving. Together, they face increasingly difficult challenges, leading to a final, desperate choice that could bring peace to the broken world.
